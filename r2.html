<center><h1>WEAVING:<br></h1>

Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth.<br>
 Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting.<br>
 The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft, woof, or filling.<br>
 The method in which these threads are interwoven affects the characteristics of the cloth.<br>
 Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them.<br>
 A fabric band that meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back strap loom, or other techniques that can be done without looms.<br>
 
The way the warp and filling threads interlace with each other is called the weave.<br>
 The majority of woven products are created with one of three basic weaves: plain weave, satin weave, or twill weave.<br>
 Woven cloth can be plain or classic (in one colour or a simple pattern), or can be woven in decorative or artistic design.<br>

<h3>Our Main Concept is to learn about Handloom, so we move to handlloms.</h3>

 
<center><h1>HANDLOOMS:<br></h1>

A hand loom, or handloom, is any loom that is manually operated, unlike motorized or electrically powered looms. <br>
It is an apparatus on which weavers create fabric by interlacing the warp and weft threads. <br>
By providing tension on the warp threads, a hand loom enables the weaver to create cloth quicker and results in a more even weave. <br>
There are numerous types of hand looms, from simple, portable backstrap looms to complicated, room-sized jacquard looms. <br>
One of the simplest hand looms is the children's loom on which they weave loops of cloth into potholders.<br>

<center><h1>Types of Handlooms:<br></h1>

<center><h3>1.PRIMITIVE OR VERTICAL LOOM.<br></h1>
<center><img src="t1.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="500" height="500"></center>

A primitive loom is generally by sinking the frame into the ground and the work inside the pit by both feet. The framework is of bamboo. This loom had been known to be in use in 5000 to 6000 years B.C. This loom is still used for weaving silk pieces, silk shirting, and sarees, Muslim, etc.by derivative weavers.

<center><h3>FEATURE:<br></h1>

This type is loom used for finer yam.
This loom has to be known to be in use 600 yarn B.C
This is throw shuttle loom
Made of wood or metal
It must be heavy and smooth
<center><h3>ADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

The first fabric is produce
By skilled labor we can get very quality fabric
Set-up cost is very low
Primitive loom can work with dobby & jacquard attachment.
<center><h3>DISADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

Slay is suspended from the top and its action is very weak using a compact or heavy cloth.
Warp threads are drawn directly from the warp beam.
Primitive loom accommodative a small can weft.
<center><h3>2. PIT LOOM<br></h1>

<center><img src="t2.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="500" height="500"></center>

Pit loom This loom is created by sunken four posters into the ground and with an overhang sley. The thread work inside the pit, so that the warp threads may absorb moisture and better weaving will result.ln, this looms the combination of sley & shuttle boxes.ln 1733 A.D John kay of Bury, England invented the”Fly Shuttle”.This invention was an extremely important event in the history and development of weaving.

<center><h3>:FEATURE<br></h1>

It fl shuttle loom
Its production is double because by the introduction of sley,shuttle-boxes
An average weaver cans weave a medium width fly-shuttle loom at 80-110 pics per minute.
Shuttle is transfer one box to another box
To control moisture loom are settled in floor that way yarn can get moisture
By this loom we get texture fabric.
<center><h3>ADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

Production is high
Moisture can easily control
May produce texture fabric
An average weaver can weave
Fly shuttle pit-loom, back and beast beam has been introduced to remove these difficulties like (knot, yarn, breakage, etc)
It can accommodate a greater quality of weft in the pirn.
<center><h3>DISADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

Difficult to control more number of heald shaft
This is one kind of handloom so large scale production is impossible
To set the loom is difficult.
<center><h3>3.FRAME LOOM:
<center><img src="t3.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="500" height="500"></center>

Frame looms almost have similar mechanisms that ground looms hold. The loom was made of rods and panels fastened at the right angles to construct a form similar to a box to make it more handy and manageable. This type of loom is being utilized even until now due to its economy and portability.
<center><h3>FEATURE:<br></h1>

This type of loom made on a frame
The movement of the slay is given by the left hand of the weaver
Twill, satin another weave more number may produce
Beam dia may high by weaving
<center><h3>ADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

It has an increased speed one hand of the weaver operates the picking handle and the other remains free to operate the slay
Fabrics of long width can as conveniently be woven as narrow ones
Larger number of heald can conveniently be operated
Ensure better selvage
Let off is done with a pawl lever arrangement.
<center><h3>DISADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

Cloth beam dia increase and make it very large
Difficult to fit the level
Fabric may compact
<center><h3>4.CHITTARANJAN LOOM.<br></h1>
<center><img src="t4.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="500" height="500"></center>

Chittaranjan type of semiautomatic loom of sturdy construction made of iron and wood commonly used in Bengal is known as Chittaranjan loom. This loom also called Japan loom.

<center><h3>FEATURE:<br></h1>

The principal characteristic of this loom lies in its beating up take up and let off motion
For beat up, two wheels upon the top shaft connect the slay at two ends with two livers
A five wheel positive take-up motion has been adopted to regulate pics per inch
Production rate is high
Shedding & picking motion in this loom work as fly shuttle loom.
<center><h3>ADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

An average can conveniently run this loom
In 80 percent Efficiency, this loom run at 120 to 140 picks per minute
It ensures uniformity in the insertion of picks per inch by the use of five wheels positive take-up motion
It also ensures uniform beat up
It is more suitable for weaving medium and coarse fabric then finer ones
The sweep of slaying to produce terry piles
<center><h3>DISADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

This is not an automatic loom
Five wheels positive take-up motion is used which gives jerky motion
Precise control of a fraction of pick is not possible
Production rate is less over the then modern loom
<center><h3>5. HATTERSLEY LOOM<br></h1>

<center><img src="t5.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="500" height="500"></center>
Hattersley Loom: ln 1856 Hattersley and hill of Keighley, Yorkshire act in the same manner as a power loom excepting the movement of the slay which may either be operated manually or by motive power to the top shaft, but the loom is constructed with lighter forming.

<center><h3>FEATURE:<br></h1>

This is the same manner of the power loom
This loom is lighter than power loom
Shredding, picking, beating up, taking up, and let off motions are automatically operated.
For taking up five wheels take-up motion is used.
Shedding is formed from the bottom shaft in case of the plain weave.
<center><h3>ADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

Maximum motion are motive by power
This loom is lighter than power loom
It also ensures uniform beat up.
It ensures uniform insertion of pick
An average weaver can conveniently run this loom.
<center><h3>DISADVANTAGE:<br></h1>

For driving manually more than 50″ read space is not control
A weaver can not weave a long time.
Five wheels take up give jerky motion.
